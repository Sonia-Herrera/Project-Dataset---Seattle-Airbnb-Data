# What the data tells us is happening in Seattle with Airbnb

### Overview
In this project, I use Python to explore a public dataset from Seattle Airbnb. 
For this analysis you will need to have the following libraries installed:
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn 
* Sklearn
* SciPy
* Datatime

This project is inspired by the work developed by Robert and how data helps us to solve very frequent and simple questions. For this project I want to solve these 3 questions:

* What is the Top 10 most popular neighborhoods for Airbnb in Seattle?
* What is the busiest season for properties in Seattle?
* According to the qualification that the properties have, what is their average price?

### The Datasets
Data about Airbnb in Seattle can be downloaded from Kaggle at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle)


### The File
In the Jupyter Notebook file you can find the analysis carried out to solve the previous questions

### The Results
The conclusions to the 3 questions that you develop:
* Capitol Hill and Ballard are the most popular neighborhoods in Seattle, but even so their composition by type of housing is very different, since in Capitol Hill apartments are more popular while in Ballard houses are more popular.
* The summer season (June-Aug) is the highest. But for this data set there is a high point in January 2016.
* With our categorization we did not find a correlation with the prices.But additional exercises could be done with other variables.

### Blog
The results to the questions are published in this [blog](https://medium.com/@scherrera/project-dataset-seattle-airbnb-data-dfea05938e3a)
